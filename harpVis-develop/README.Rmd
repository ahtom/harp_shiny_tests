_Visualization of meteorological and verification data_

harpVis provides functions for plotting data produced by other harp packages, 
whether that be gridded forecast data from harpIO or verification data produced 
by harpPoint and harpSpatial. 

Most of the plotting functions (except for `plot_field()`) use the 
[ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) package in the background, meaning 
that the plots can be saved with 
[`ggsave()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggsave.html).

In addition to direct plotting, harpVis provides 
[shiny](https://shiny.posit.co/) apps for interactively displaying verification 
plots in a web browser, along with the option to build your own apps from 
modules. 

## Installation

You can install harpVis from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("harphub/harpVis")
```
